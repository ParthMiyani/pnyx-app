                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Apple Pie\" by Travis Scott is open to interpretation, as the lyrics are quite abstract and can be subject to personal interpretation. However, the song seems to touch on themes of success, ambition, and wanting to create one's own legacy. Travis Scott references his fame and success, expressing that he doesn't need validation from others or their approval. He wants to make his mark in the industry and establish his own unique identity and sound. The line \"I don't want your apple pie\" could symbolize rejecting conformity or traditional success and instead seeking something more unconventional and authentic. The song also mentions the Rodeo, which could be a metaphor for the music industry as a whole and the challenges and sacrifices one must face to achieve success. Overall, \"Apple Pie\" can be seen as Travis Scott's declaration to carve his own path and create his own legacy in the music industry.",

The lyrics also touch on themes of partying, relationships, and the superficiality of material possessions.

The song talks about how the singer is constantly on the move and has many options and opportunities available to them. They emphasize their success and how they have achieved things that others have not. However, amidst the fast-paced lifestyle, the singer acknowledges that sometimes things can become overwhelming and they may need to slow down.

Overall, the song highlights both the excitement and the difficulties of living a fast-paced life and emphasizes the singer's determination to keep moving forward despite any obstacles.",

The lyrics speak of the \"summer snow,\" a metaphorical representation of unexpected and rare occurrences. The singer acknowledges that these moments can be shocking or even uncomfortable, but also emphasizes that they are transient and will eventually fade away. The song encourages the listener not to fret or dwell on these fleeting experiences, as they will not have a lasting impact. Instead, the lyrics suggest focusing on the present and finding joy in the moment, as well as cherishing the memories and experiences that come with love and living fully. Overall, the song reminds the listener to appreciate the beauty and impermanence of life's unexpected moments.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"The Lighthouse's Tale\" by Nickel Creek is a story about love, loss, and the resilience of a lighthouse. The song is narrated from the perspective of the lighthouse itself, personifying it as a worn and weathered figure. The lighthouse tells the story of a keeper who helps warn ships at sea and finds joy and companionship in his relationship with a girl who is described as beautiful and full of light.\n\nHowever, tragedy strikes when the girl is lost at sea during a storm, leaving the keeper devastated. He buries her on the shore and, overcome by grief, chooses to end his own life by jumping off the lighthouse.\n\nThe song explores the themes of love, loss, and the passage of time. It emphasizes the enduring nature of the lighthouse, which continues to warn sailors despite its loneliness and emptiness. The waves crashing, sand slipping away, and winds blowing serve as reminders of the past and the impossibility of what once was and can never be again.\n\nOverall, the song conveys a sense of longing, melancholy, and the bittersweet nature of love and loss. It highlights the enduring strength and purpose of the lighthouse, acting as a metaphor for resilience in the face of tragedy and the ability to carry on in the midst of grief.",

The song contains explicit language and aggressive lyrics, with Sheck Wes proclaiming his dominance and success. He references his lifestyle as a \"mudboy,\" which could signify his come-up from humble beginnings or his connection to the streets. The repeated use of the word \"bitch\" in the song is explained as a way for Sheck Wes to release anger and frustration, rather than being about women. The song also references Sheck Wes' affiliation with New York and his disregard for gossip or drama. Overall, the song showcases Sheck Wes' confident and assertive persona, highlighting his success, lifestyle, and attitude.",

The lyrics describe a lifestyle filled with drugs, money, and promiscuity. The singers boast about having expensive diamonds, expensive steps, and a stash of money. They also mention their drug use, particularly mentioning oxy, lean, and percocet. The song overall portrays a sense of rebellion, with the singers disregarding societal norms and engaging in risky behaviors. The lyrics also touch on the idea of selling out shows and the desire for more success and money. Ultimately, the song portrays a lifestyle that may be seen as glamorous and exciting to some, but also carries the consequences of substance abuse and a lack of stability.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Arson\" by City Morgue, ZillaKami, SosMula is much darker and more violent than \"Too Much Time on My Hands.\" The song portrays a sense of destruction, chaos, and disregard for human life. The lyrics contain explicit references to arson, violence, and killing, suggesting a desire to watch the world burn and inflict harm on others for pleasure. The song depicts a dark, aggressive and nihilistic worldview that celebrates violence and destruction. It can be seen as an expression of anger, rebellion, and a rejection of societal norms. The meaning behind the lyrics suggests a fascination with the macabre, showcasing a desire to shock and provoke with its disturbing and violent imagery.",

The singer acknowledges that they may not be the main attraction, but they are grateful for the opportunity to perform and the support from the audience. They express a willingness to take risks and learn from their mistakes, understanding that failure is a part of growth. The song also touches on the challenges faced in the music industry due to the internet and the changing landscape of music consumption. Despite these obstacles, the singer remains dedicated to their craft and finds solace in their instrument, the Fender guitar. The chorus questions why the singer is being treated like a stranger and why their music may not be seen as good enough, highlighting the struggles and insecurities that artists often face. Overall, the song encourages perseverance and finding joy in the journey, regardless of the level of success.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"High off You\" by Yo Trane is a narrative about a person who is reflecting on their past relationship. The singer acknowledges that fame and success are not fulfilling, and at the end of the day, they are just a regular person seeking love and connection. The person receives a surprising call from their ex-lover, which brings back memories and emotions. They admit that things haven't been the same since the person left and that they still think about the good times they had. The singer confesses to having many distractions in their life, such as other girls and drugs, but they would rather be high on the presence and love of their ex-partner because nothing else compares. They regret their past behavior and acknowledge that they took their partner for granted, leading to their departure. Despite their mistakes, they still long for their ex-lover and express a desire for reconciliation. The song portrays the person's genuine feelings of missing and needing their ex-partner, and their realization that they were the one person who truly understood and believed in them. Ultimately, \"High off You\" is a heartfelt plea for a second chance at love and a recognition of the value of a genuine connection with someone special.",

The singer expresses their dedication and commitment to this person, describing how they have given them flowers and will pray for them. The lyrics also touch on the pain of losing something that was once there and the importance of love in one's life. The song ultimately conveys a sense of hope and determination to fulfill the promise made, even in the face of challenges and uncertainty. It emphasizes the power of love and the impact it can have on one's life. Overall, \"I Promised Myself\" is a declaration of love and a reminder of the importance of keeping promises to the ones we care about.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Paper\" by Johnny Yukon is centered around the theme of materialism and the superficiality of relationships centered around money. The song describes encounters with individuals who are solely interested in financial gain and are willing to do whatever it takes to obtain it. The lyrics suggest a sense of detachment and lack of emotional connection, with the protagonist expressing a desire to go back home, presumably to a place where genuine relationships and connections exist. The repetition of wanting to go home can be seen as a longing for authenticity and a longing to escape from the shallow world depicted in the song. Ultimately, the song is highlighting the emptiness and hollowness of relationships based solely on material wealth and emphasizes the importance of genuine human connection and emotional depth.",

The lyrics depict the singer wanting attention, recognition, and material possessions. The use of slang and the repetition of phrases like \"I need honey\" and \"I got smoke, I got henny\" emphasize the singer's desire for indulgence and pleasure. The lyrics also touch on themes of partying, relationships, and the superficiality of material possessions. Overall, the song portrays a sense of craving for instant gratification and a disregard for consequences.",

The singer expresses their realization that the person they were once attached to was not good for them and that they no longer need them in their life. The lyrics convey a sense of newfound freedom and independence as the singer declares their ability to be happy and content without the other person. The bright blue skies symbolize a fresh start and a brighter outlook on life now that the toxic relationship is over. Overall, the song communicates a message of self-confidence and resilience in letting go of unhealthy attachments and embracing a positive future.",

The lyrics describe a sense of lethargy and numbness, as if the person is going through the motions without truly experiencing or feeling anything. The singer recognizes that there is so much more to life and wants to be awakened to something real and meaningful. The repeated line of \"tell me everything will be okay\" suggests a longing for reassurance and hope in the midst of this emotional emptiness. Overall, the song conveys a desire for a deeper connection and purpose, urging the listener to break free from their complacency and fully embrace life.",

He emphasizes that he is not interested in counting money or selling drugs, and instead prefers to receive payment in a discrete and legal manner, through an envelope rather than a bag. Ice Cube asserts his disapproval of those who engage in drug dealing and highlights the negative consequences that can arise from participating in such activities. He also addresses the issue of addiction and the impact it has on communities. Overall, the song serves as a critique of the drug trade and a declaration of Ice Cube's refusal to be involved in it.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"SOPRANO\" by Duckwrth is open to interpretation as the lyrics contain various themes and imagery. The song incorporates references to music, religion, and personal experiences to create a unique and abstract narrative.\n\nThe lyrics touch upon themes of rebellion and defying societal norms. Duckwrth challenges traditional expectations by advocating for secular music and embracing its rebellious and energetic nature. He associates music with power and liberation, suggesting that it can uplift and empower individuals.\n\nThe mention of Lucifer singing in soprano and fallen angels listening to Zeppelin adds a darker and mysterious tone to the song. These references could be interpreted as a metaphor for the allure of temptation or the conflicting nature of good and evil.\n\nAdditionally, the lyrics include mentions of violence and aggression, but it's important to note that they might be metaphorical or symbolic expressions rather than literal acts. Duckwrth frequently uses vivid imagery and wordplay to create a sense of intensity and urgency within the song.\n\nOverall, \"SOPRANO\" explores themes of rebellion, empowerment through music, and the complexity of human nature. The song encourages listeners to embrace their individuality and challenge societal expectations.",

The lyrics explore the idea that everyone has both positive and negative qualities within them, and it's important not to judge or criticize others based on their flaws. The song emphasizes the importance of empathy, kindness, and recognizing the potential for growth and change in oneself and others. It suggests that instead of focusing on the mistakes and failures of others, it's more beneficial to try to understand their experiences and look for the good in them.

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Glow Like Dat\" by Rich Brian is that of reflection and longing for a past relationship. The lyrics describe a sense of pride and admiration for the person they are singing about, reminiscing about the times they spent together. The singer acknowledges that the end of the relationship has affected them deeply and they still carry the person in their thoughts, living in their head without a doubt. They express their anxiety and attachment to the person, symbolized by wearing their picture on a necklace. The lyrics also touch on themes of self-destructive behavior, such as smoking cigarettes and seeking temporary fixes. Overall, the song captures the emotions and thoughts that arise when someone is still emotionally attached to a past relationship and struggles to move on.",

The lyrics suggest a battle with inner demons and feelings of exhaustion, as well as a desire for escape or even death. The references to omens, demons, and zombies create a haunting atmosphere, symbolizing the internal turmoil and darkness that the artists are fighting against. The song also touches on the pressure of fame and the music industry, with a rejection of conformity and a desire to stay true to their own lane. Overall, \"Suicide Forest\" portrays a raw and introspective look into the artists' personal struggles and serves as both a cathartic release and a reminder that others may also be facing their own demons.",

The song seems to focus on themes of sexuality, confidence, and self-expression. The lyrics contain various references to Italian culture, such as Italian draws and Pizanos, which could symbolize the singer's appreciation for luxury and aesthetics. The song also touches on themes of power dynamics in relationships and sexual encounters. Smino's verses are filled with wordplay and clever rhymes, showcasing his lyrical mastery. Overall, \"PIZANO\" can be seen as a bold and playful expression of self-confidence and individuality.",

The singer compares their rise to fame and success to that of basketball player Stephen Curry, who is known for his skill and talent on the court. The lyrics express a sense of surprise and disbelief at the singer's current level of success, as they never would have imagined it in the past. The mention of cutting the net symbolizes achieving a significant milestone or goal, indicating that the singer is winning and excelling in their endeavors. Despite facing adversity and doubters, the singer is confident and determined to keep pushing forward and enjoying their newfound success. The lyrics also touch on themes of loyalty and authenticity, as the singer acknowledges those who have supported them from the beginning and distances themselves from those who have shown fake love or switched sides. Overall, the song conveys a sense of triumph, confidence, and the perseverance required to achieve one's dreams.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"DEADPOOL\" by Famous Dex is about the rapper's experiences with mistrust, fake friends, and the pursuit of money. He expresses his skepticism towards women who are only interested in his wealth and material possessions, emphasizing that he doesn't consider them to be his true companions. Famous Dex also talks about how some of his close friends have changed their behavior and become disloyal for financial gain. Despite the negative experiences, he acknowledges that he had to go through those situations to learn and grow. The references to Deadpool, including the line \"I will shoot you, Deadpool,\" may symbolize the rapper's own determination and resilience in the face of adversity. The overall message of the song seems to be about overcoming obstacles and staying focused on personal success, even in a world where trust is hard to come by.",

                "harmix_story": "\"The One\" by Those Chosen is a song that touches upon themes of power, corruption, and the manipulation of truth. The lyrics mention the darkness that has fallen over Memphis on the anniversary of Elvis Presley's death, symbolizing a loss of innocence or purity. The \"pretenders\" in the palace represent those in positions of power who speak deceptively or dishonestly. The line about changes in the valley suggests a shift in the status quo, with the renegades settling down and embracing rival ideologies or beliefs.\n\nThe song further explores the idea of false worship and the desecration of core values or traditions. The chorus highlights the voices of those who claim to take care of the chosen ones, but it is left ambiguous whether these chosen ones are truly being protected or exploited. The mention of mission bells ringing adds a religious or spiritual element, perhaps questioning the sincerity of prayers or rituals.\n\nThe lyrics also allude to the pouring of oil on troubled waters, which typically signifies an attempt to calm or pacify a situation. However, the line about burying secrets in the sand suggests a cover-up or avoidance of truth. The reference to a message in the Bible and the denial of a master and slave relationship alludes to the manipulation of religious or moral principles for personal gain.\n\nOverall, \"The One\" by Those Chosen is a thought-provoking song that explores themes of power, manipulation, and the complexity of truth. It encourages listeners to question authority, examine hidden motives, and seek genuine understanding amidst a world filled with deceit and corruption.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Carnival Town\" by Norah Jones is one of reflection and longing. The song describes a carousel and ferris wheel at a carnival, using them as metaphors for life's ups and downs. The lyrics suggest that despite the excitement and movement of the carnival, there is a sense of emptiness and loneliness. The reference to the clown implies a temporary happiness that eventually fades away, leaving the subject feeling lost and wandering.\n\nThe song explores themes of yearning for genuine connection and questioning the transient nature of relationships. The repetitive use of the word \"lonely\" emphasizes the feeling of isolation and the desire for someone to share life's highs and lows. Overall, \"Carnival Town\" explores the complexities of human emotions and the search for meaningful connections within a transient world.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Power Down\" by Benjamin Francis Leftwich is about taking a break from the chaos of life and finding peace in solitude. The lyrics suggest the need to disconnect from the outside world and reflect on oneself. The phrase \"power down\" implies shutting off distractions and allowing oneself to recharge mentally and emotionally. The song also touches on the idea of personal growth and transformation, as the singer mentions the need to disappear in order to develop and evolve. The lyrics emphasize the importance of introspection and the separation of what is truly essential from what is just taken for granted. Ultimately, the song encourages the listener to embrace moments of stillness and introspection to find clarity and discover what truly matters.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Cold in LA\" by Why Don't We is a story of longing and uncertainty in a romantic relationship. The singer expresses their feelings of insecurity and confusion about the other person's intentions and emotions. They question whether the other person is truly interested in them and wonder if they are just playing games. Despite the confusion, the singer still desires the other person's presence and wishes they would stay. The reference to \"cold in LA\" suggests that even in a glamorous city like Los Angeles, where the weather is typically warm, the singer feels a sense of emotional coldness and detachment in their relationship. Overall, the song explores the complexities and challenges of navigating a romantic connection, highlighting the desire for deeper emotional connection and the fear of being left behind.",

The singer is willing to give their body to the person they're singing to, emphasizing the deep emotional and physical connection they share. The lyrics suggest that this connection is so powerful that the singer is willing to break rules and be vulnerable, even if others may judge them for it. The song explores the idea of being unable to resist the other person and finding solace and completeness in their presence. The phrase \"being without you is impossible\" highlights the significance of this connection in the singer's life.

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Speak To Me\" by Kari Jobe is a deep longing to hear from God and have a personal connection with Him. The lyrics describe the power and awe-inspiring nature of God's voice, comparing it to the sound of many waters and fireworks igniting in the chest. The song portrays the speaker's desire for God to speak to them and meet their needs, to break through their inhibitions and settle their soul. The lyrics highlight the intimacy of God's voice, closer than their own skin and moving them in a profound way. The speaker hangs on to every word God says and lives to hear Him speak their name. The song ultimately captures the reverent and awe-filled response to the presence and communication of God. It emphasizes the deep longing for a personal connection and guidance from a higher power.",

The title \"FUCK 12\" is a derogatory term used to express anger and frustration towards the police or law enforcement. The lyrics describe the experiences and struggles faced by Black individuals, including racial profiling, discrimination, and violence. The song also touches on the importance of unity within the Black community and the need for self-empowerment. The repeated refrain of \"fuck 12\" serves as a call to action and a rallying cry against the injustices faced by Black people. Overall, the song promotes resistance against systemic racism and oppression while amplifying the voices of those affected.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Wasting All These Tears\" by Cassadee Pope is about the pain and frustration of being in a one-sided and unfulfilling relationship. The singer realizes that they have been investing their time, emotions, and tears into someone who doesn't care about them. They have reached a breaking point and decide that they deserve better, choosing to move on from the toxic relationship. The lyrics convey a sense of empowerment and determination to let go of the pain and focus on their own well-being. The song encourages listeners to recognize their own worth and not waste their emotions on someone who doesn't appreciate or reciprocate their love. It serves as a reminder to prioritize one's own happiness and not dwell on those who have hurt them in the past.",

The singer implies that this person had doubts about their potential and abilities, and when they proved them wrong and achieved success, the person turned their back on them. The singer acknowledges that they have grown and accomplished things that the other person only dreamed of, suggesting that they no longer need or want their friendship. The lyrics convey a sense of resentment and detachment, as the singer no longer remembers how they used to feel or the connection they once had. The song encourages the listener to let go of toxic relationships and to focus on their own growth and happiness.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning of \"Sixth Sense\" by Roniit is open to interpretation as it can resonate differently with each listener. However, a common interpretation is that the song is about the singer's struggle with a toxic or unhealthy relationship. The lyrics suggest a sense of detachment and fading away from oneself, trying to escape the negative influence of the other person. The singer mentions using illusions and seeking solace, indicating that they may have been relying on their own defense mechanisms to cope with the situation. The line \"I don't need a safe word\" could imply a lack of trust or unwillingness to communicate openly in the relationship. Despite the difficulties, the singer emphasizes their own strength and self-sufficiency, stating that they are enough. The reference to the sixth sense may suggest a heightened intuition or ability to perceive things beyond the ordinary, indicating that the singer has developed a sense of self-awareness and is becoming more attuned to their own needs and boundaries. Overall, the song explores themes of self-preservation, finding strength within oneself, and maintaining personal boundaries in challenging relationships.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Consume\" by Chase Atlantic is a complex and dark exploration of personal struggles, relationships, and self-destructive behaviors. The song describes a toxic and tumultuous relationship where both parties are aware of each other's destructive tendencies. The narrator acknowledges their own flaws and the potential harm they can cause, but also expresses a desire for connection and intimacy.\n\nThe lyrics touch on themes of addiction, mental health, and the internal battles faced by the narrator. There is a sense of chaos and desperation throughout the song, with references to cutting corners, running from one's problems, and the voices in the narrator's head.\n\nThe chorus emphasizes the narrator's humanity and vulnerability, contrasting with the dangerous and destructive elements of the relationship. The bridge introduces a new perspective, with Goon Des Garcons providing a rap verse that delves deeper into the narrator's struggles with anxiety and his efforts to maintain control.\n\nOverall, \"Consume\" speaks to the complicated nature of human relationships, the internal demons we all face, and the destructive patterns that can consume our lives if left unchecked. It serves as a reminder to be aware of our actions and the potential harm we can cause, both to ourselves and others.",

The song acknowledges that others may judge or underestimate the relationship or lifestyle of the couple in the song, but they remain steadfast in their love and belief that they have everything they need. The lyrics suggest that material possessions or societal expectations do not define the strength of their relationship. The couple rejects the opinions and negativity of others, declaring that no one can compare to what they have together. Overall, the song celebrates the power of love and the ability to find happiness and contentment despite external pressures or judgments.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"This Woman Loves You\" by Wet is that of a woman who deeply loves and cares for someone, but feels limited in how much she can express that love. The lyrics suggest that this love is powerful and all-encompassing, symbolized by the reference to the entire country and sea to shining sea. However, the woman feels confined by the restrictions placed on her by the person she loves. She is willing to go to great lengths and make sacrifices for this person, but feels that her love is not fully reciprocated or acknowledged.\n\nThe lyrics also touch on themes of uncertainty and insecurity in the relationship. The woman expresses her vulnerability and desire for reassurance, hoping that her love will not be taken lightly or dismissed. Despite the challenges and obstacles they face, she remains dedicated and committed to the relationship.\n\nOverall, the song portrays a complex and intense love where the woman's feelings are deep and genuine, but she grapples with the limitations and uncertainties within the relationship. It explores the dynamics of love and the emotional struggles that can arise when one person's love is not fully recognized or reciprocated by the other.",

The lyrics suggest that the singer has been mistreated and taken for granted by their partner. They express feelings of frustration, hurt, and anger towards their partner's actions and decide to detach themselves from the toxic relationship. The phrase \"put one in the air\" refers to smoking or consuming marijuana as a way to cope with the emotional pain and as a form of self-care or relaxation. Ultimately, the song is about finding the strength to walk away from a toxic relationship and prioritize self-love and well-being.",

They recognize that they deserve better and are starting to question their love for their partner. The lyrics convey a sense of frustration and disappointment, as well as the realization that it's time to leave and stop keeping score in the relationship.

The song acknowledges that there may be external forces or people who disapprove of the relationship, symbolized by the reference to different flags. However, the lyrics emphasize that despite these differences, the love and value between the two individuals remain the same. The song encourages unity and celebrates the idea that love knows no boundaries or limits. It emphasizes the importance of sticking together and fighting for love, even if it means going against societal norms. The lyrics also convey a sense of empowerment and determination to overcome any obstacles or challenges that may come their way. Overall, \"Flags\" conveys a message of love, unity, and the power of embracing diversity in relationships.",

                "harmix_story": "The meaning behind \"Pope Is a Rockstar\" by SALES is open to interpretation, as the lyrics are abstract and don't provide specific context. One possible interpretation could be that the song is about breaking free from societal expectations or norms. The reference to the Pope as a rockstar could symbolize someone who is revered or idolized, but also has a rebellious or nonconformist side. The lyrics suggest a desire to break free from constraints and have open and honest communication, even if it goes against societal norms. The mention of waiting for the world to \"untrack\" and fighting for what is worthwhile could indicate a longing for change or a desire for something more meaningful in life. Overall, the song seems to convey a sense of individuality and a rejection of conformity.",

The song expresses gratitude for the presence of a friend who is there in both good times and bad, providing solace, encouragement, and a sense of shared experience. The lyrics suggest that having someone to lean on makes life's challenges feel less overwhelming and its joys even more rewarding. The song also acknowledges the inevitability of growing older and recognizes that even though the future may hold uncertainties, having a companion to navigate through it makes it all the more manageable. Ultimately, \"Twice As Good\" encourages listeners to cherish and appreciate the relationships that bring strength, comfort, and an enhanced experience of life.",
