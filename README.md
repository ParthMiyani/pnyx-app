## Partner Information and Project Description

* PNYX
* Contact: Asar Qadir (CEO), asarqadir@gmail.com
* PNYX is an interactive platform designed for uncovering exclusive and unreleased music, gamifying the discovery process. Emphasizing content quality over artists' outward presentation and promotional budgets, PNYX provides users with a distinctive experience. Through the platform, users can discover hidden tracks, make purchases, and access exclusive features like merchandise, concert tickets, and meet-and-greet opportunities.

## Team Information

* Lance, Maroosh, Vidhi, Shakeeb, Thomas, Rakan, Andrew

## Key Features
 * Describe the key features in the application that the user can access.
      
       - The user can auction the songs they bought
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature.
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

 * Users can create account and log in to the PNYX app.
 * Users can access the following screens:
    - Home Screen:
    - Music Player Screen:
    - Library Screen:
 * Users will get tailored music reccomendations through the ML system.
 * Users can make payments to purchase tracks/albums/other exclusive merchandise.
 * The user can select the type of genre of the songs they want to get recommended for.
 * The user would get reccomend random songs without revealing what the song is
 * The user can unlock the songs using tokens that regenerate daily
 * The user can change the theme of the website
​
## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.

 * Users will first register their account and log in to the PNYX application.
 
 ## Development requirements
 * What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 * You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started.
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow
​
Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
​
 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
 * Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 * Our team will be divided into 3 sub-teams to handle the front-end, back-end and Machine Learning aspects of the app.

 ## Coding Standards and Guidelines
 Keep this section brief, a maximum of 2-3 lines. You would want to read through this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/) to get more context about what this section is for before attempting to answer.
  * These are 2 optional resources that you might want to go through: [article with High level explanation](https://blog.codacy.com/coding-standards-what-are-they-and-why-do-you-need-them/) and [this article with Detailed Explanation](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
​ * Name variables and functions based on what they do
 * Use Getter and Setter functions
 * avoid the use of digits in variable names.
 * 150 Characters per line
 * Code should be easily understandable, comment sections of code if necessary
 ## Licenses 
​
 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.
​
 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase? And why?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
