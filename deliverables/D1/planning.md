# PNYX/Team 7
> _Note:_ This document will evolve throughout your project. You commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section). 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Specify if you have a partner and who they are.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app, browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the partner or the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

 * Musical Artists who:
   -	Are looking for alternatives to popular music streaming apps (such as Spotify or Apple Music) as currently, they only earn around 12% of the industry revenue (as the rest goes to the aforementioned apps, and their labels etc.)
   -	Are looking to try out new genres of music outside of their usual output, whether that is due to a certain image they have built around them, or if their producers/label/managers want them to put out what is expected to be successful.
   -	Want to earn a 98% profit on anything they sell through the PNYX app.
   -	Want to be recognized only on the quality of music they create.
* Fans and “superfans” of artists who:
  -	Want to engage with music in a more gamified manner through a “blind audition” style.
  -	Want to engage purely with the music regardless of marketing and prior biases/knowledge (or lack thereof) of artists.
  -	Want access to exclusive perks such as (discord conversations, one on one conversations, meet and greets, tickets to concerts)
  -	Want to directly support artists.
  -	Want ownership of limited-edition versions of songs.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how and how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools to be used or being considered. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?

## Intellectual Property Confidentiality Agreement 
> Note this section is **not marked** but must be completed briefly if you have a partner. If you have any questions, please ask on Piazza.
>  
**By default, you own any work that you do as part of your coursework.** However, some partners may want you to keep the project confidential after the course is complete. As part of your first deliverable, you should discuss and agree upon an option with your partner. Examples include:
1. You can share the software and the code freely with anyone with or without a license, regardless of domain, for any use.
2. You can upload the code to GitHub or other similar publicly available domains.
3. You will only share the code under an open-source license with the partner but agree to not distribute it in any way to any other entity or individual. 
4. You will share the code under an open-source license and distribute it as you wish but only the partner can access the system deployed during the course.
5. You will only reference the work you did in your resume, interviews, etc. You agree to not share the code or software in any capacity with anyone unless your partner has agreed to it.

## Teamwork Details

#### Q6: Have you met with your team?

Do a team-building activity in-person or online. This can be playing an online game, meeting for bubble tea, lunch, or any other activity you all enjoy.
* Get to know each other on a more personal level.
* Provide a few sentences on what you did and share a picture or other evidence of your team building activity.
* Share at least three fun facts from members of you team (total not 3 for each member).

* 3 Team Fun Facts:
  - Lance likes to collect sneakers.
  - Maroosh has been to 10 different schools throughout his life.
  - C++ was the first coding language that Andrew learned.
* For the team building activity, we played Scribl.io together (screenshot attached below) as a fun way to get to know each other. It was difficult to meet in person due to scheduling issues, so we decided that this was the best available option.
* ![image](https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/deliverable-1-25-pnyx/assets/76667567/9d2cb071-ef0c-4346-8aaa-0558ea3a3108)



#### Q7: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. One person may have multiple roles.  
 * Add role(s) to your Team-[Team_Number]-[Team_Name].csv file on the main folder.
 * At least one person must be identified as the dedicated partner liaison. They need to have great organization and communication skills.
 * Everyone must contribute to code. Students who don't contribute to code enough will receive a lower mark at the end of the term.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * Why did you choose them to take that role? Specify if they are interested in learning that part, experienced in it, or any other reasons. Do no make things up. This part is not graded but may be reviewed later.


#### Q8: How will you work as a team?

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have. 
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.
 * You should have 2 meetings with your project partner (if you have one) before D1 is due. Describe them here:
   * You must keep track of meeting minutes and add them to your repo under "deliverables/minutes" folder
   * You must have a regular meeting schedule established for the rest of the term.
  
   * Meet at least once a week (tentatively on Fridays) online through discord, open to meeting more if needed.
   * The purpose of meeting will be to discuss current progress, any issues that have arisen and how we want to proceed. If there is a deliverable due, we will discuss that as well – so a weekly sync meeting.
  
#### Q9: How will you organize your team?

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), meeting minutes, etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done? (You must grant your TA and partner access to systems you use to manage work)
   * **How do you prioritize tasks?**
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   * How do you determine the status of work from inception to completion?

#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

**Communications:**
 * What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels will be used? 
 * If you have a partner project, what is your process for communicating with your partner?
 
**Collaboration: (Share your responses to Q8 & Q9 from A1)**
 * How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?
 * How will you address the issue if one person doesn't contribute or is not responsive?

**Communications:**
* Meet team members at least once a week through Discord calls, but will be communicating through Discord text messages consistently (almost every day).
* Meet PNYX partners at least once a week through Zoom calls (tentatively every Friday), other communication through emails.

**Collaboration:**
* Roles of interest (Assignment 1, Q8):
  - Maroosh: Full-stack developer, Backend developer, Frontend developer, Database developer
  - Lance: Frontend developer, Team manager
* What can each member contribute to the team? (Assignment 1, Q9):
  - Maroosh: I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL (Postgres). I am currently taking CSC309, so I should be helpful in web programming by learning React, Django, and RESTful APIs. I am also a highly motivated individual and work well in a team setting. I am open to communication and receptive to advice and suggestions.
** I NEED HELP ANSWERING THESE 2 QUESTIONS BELOW**
* How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?
 * How will you address the issue if one person doesn't contribute or is not responsive?




## Organisation Details

#### Q11. How does your team fit within the overall team organisation of the partner?
* Given the team structure of your partner, what role do you think your team will play?
* Examples include product development that includes developing new features, or quality assurance that includes developing features that test the product reliability, or software maintenance that includes fixing crucial bugs in the product.
* Provide examples of why you think you fit this role.

#### Q12. How does your project fit within the overall product from the partner?
* Look at the big picture of the product and think about how your project fits into this product.
* Is your project the first step towards building this product? Is it the first prototype? Are you developing the frontend of a product whose backend is developed by the partner? Are you building the release pipelines for a product that is developed by the partner? Are you building a core feature set and take full ownership of these features?
* You should also provide details of who else is contributing to what parts of the product, if you have this information. This is more important if the project that you will be working on has strong coupling with parts that will be contributed to by members other than your team (e.g. from partner).
* You can be creative for these questions and even use a graphical or pictorial representation to demonstrate the fit.

* Our project’s priority will be do fully implement the frontend of the PNYX mobile app to have it ready to be tested within 2 months. Thus, we are essentially building the frontend for the first prototype in real user hands. The main functionality of the backend has already been developed by the partner, however there is room for additions, such as improving the ML models for song recommendation and user matching, as well as moving from Stripe API to a blockchain integration based approach for payment and transaction management. If tester feedback is given back while we are still on this project, we will be implementing that as well.
